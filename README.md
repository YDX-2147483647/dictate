        ```

    2. Restart bash and you should have tab-completion now.

-   Zsh

    1. Append `~/.zfunc` to `fpath` in your zsh config

        **NOTICE**: Make sure to insert the following line before initializing
        `compinit`.

        ```bash
        fpath+=("$HOME/.zfunc")
        ```

    2. Create the appended directory and dump completion definition to
       `~/.zfunc/_dictate`

        ```bash
        mkdir -p ~/.zfunc
        dictate complete zsh > ~/.zfunc/_dictate
        ```

    3. Restart zsh and you should have tab-completion now.

    **NOTE**: In case it's not working yet, delete `~/.zcompdump` and restart
    your shell again.
